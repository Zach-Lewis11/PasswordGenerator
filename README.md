# PasswordGenerator

  Challenge to use JavaScript to make a password generator with choices for criteria

## Goal of the Project

  The purpose of this app it to generate a random password between 8 and 26 chareters long while using the critera that the use selects through a series of promts when the "Generate Password" button is clicked on the web page. In this chalange, we where asked to use what we have learned about Java script up until this point to carry out this project. 

## How To

  to use this project, when that page loads in, click generate password. This action will bring up a promt asking how many chaarecters you would like the password to be. if you end a amount less that 8, greater than 26, or someting other than a number, you will be alerted to please enter a number between 8 and 26. If, however, you enter an amount between 8 and 26, you will then be giving a series of confermations, asking if you would like the password to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special symbols. If you have said ' Confirm' to one or more catigories, the randomized password will then be displayed in the text box on the page.
